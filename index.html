            <h1>Rites of Passage and other Ceremonies</h1>
            <p>African communities have many traditions when it comes to rites of passage.</p>

             <p>This is a ritual of passage which occurs when an individual passes one group to another.</p>
             <ol>
               <li> Initiation
               <p> This is a rite of passage where a group of same age undergoes.It may be circumcision,removal of lower teeth.
                
                Some communities used to circumcise both boys and girls and when people of same age where circumcised together they joined same age-set.</p>
            </li>
                
                <li>Birth rites</li>
                <p>In some african countries birth takes place in the house of the expectant mother. In South Africa birth takes place on a grinding 
                stone as a symbol of womans hardwork. In Ethiopia the mother does it alone in the bush and returns home with the child after
                 delivery while in in kenya, when a gikuyu woman gives birth she screams five times if the child is a boy and four times if its a girl.</p>
