                Some communities used to circumcise both boys and girls and when people of same age where circumcised together they joined same age-set.</p>
            </li>
                
                <li>Birth rites</li>
                <p>In some african countries birth takes place in the house of the expectant mother. In South Africa birth takes place on a grinding 
                stone as a symbol of womans hardwork. In Ethiopia the mother does it alone in the bush and returns home with the child after
                 delivery while in in kenya, when a gikuyu woman gives birth she screams five times if the child is a boy and four times if its a girl.</p>
